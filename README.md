# NovicePython
I'm learning Python! Here's my project(s) in progress.
## My First Repository Input
was made today, 6/14/2023. I'm just messing around, learning, and being transparent during this process.  There's not much to communicate yet, but keep posted. The upload today speaks for itself (Basic_Quiz_Game_Silly). Can be found under tabbykatty / NovicePython.  

### I made my second input today 
on 6/15/2023. The code is choppy still, but functional. I spent about an hour learning and practicing using Python in Kaggle, using a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&t=1505s"> YouTube video!</a> to help me with a guided project.
